3. Using Google API identify where the using is dropping the Pin
4. Calculate the crow flies distance between the actual location and the location selected. 
5. Identify point system based on the distance (inverse. More distance less points).
6. Have a progress bar which will timeout for 10 seconds and then display the answer if the user fails
